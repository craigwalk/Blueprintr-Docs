# Feature Lifecycle

## Feature Idea
Someone has an idea for a feature. This idea might stem from business requirements, user research that uncovered a problem, from feature requests of existing users, or just from thin air.

1. Create the idea in  [Trello](https://trello.com/ms9capp)
2. Think about how the idea can benefit the user
3. Scope out a summary and a few dotpoints on examples
