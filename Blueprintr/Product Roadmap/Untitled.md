# Overview: Martin Short's 9 Categories


The Martin Short 9 Categories app is a free and open source digital implementation of the "9 Categories" chapter of Martin Short's autobiography *Must Say: My Life as a Humble Comedy Legend*. The methodology that Martin Short uses  involves a weekly journal of different aspects of his life where he set questions about the last week and graded these on a score of using colour grades from red to green. The grades are then summed up to give an overall GPA for the week to see the progress and overall grade of his life week to week. 

In the early 70s and 80s before he was a big star, Martin Short was a working actor trying to make his big break. As a Canadian opportunities were far and in between and while he actively tried to get work there were seldom opportunities available. Thankfully, his career was not the first and foremost predication of his happiness.  

In the words of Martin Short himself...

"Recognizing that prolonged periods of unemployment are part of an actor’s lot, I devised a rigorous self-evaluation system that I call the Nine Categories. I know, it sounds like some sort of scary Illuminati initiation gauntlet, but to me it was merely my benign, orderly way of taking personal inventory: objectively weighing the good against the bad. I wanted to see if I could use logic to overcome emotion.

I decided to systematically compare my performance in that one specific category of my life—work—with my performance in the other important life categories, and to give them all equal importance. My mind has always worked systematically to begin with. For example, I still operate according to the school-year calendar, where September heralds a new start and May/June the conclusion of another grade; as I write this, in the spring of 2014, I am finishing up what I think of as Grade 59.

Since I was already thinking of time in school-year terms, I decided to think of life in course-load terms, with the main objective being to maintain a credible GPA. I might be getting a D in career, I thought, but if I got good marks in some of the other subjects, I could bring my average up. After thinking long and hard, I drew up what I thought of as the course load of life, aka the Nine Categories."

# The Nine Categories

## Category 1: Self

The logical starting point. Without a highly functioning self, nothing else works. It can be anything from “Have you had your yearly physical?” to “What’s your current weight?” to “Any blood on the pillow this morning?” Everything else in life unravels if you’re not perpetuating your own survival. You have to take care of yourself, and when you do, try and lock the door so no one walks in on you.


## Category 2:  Immediate Family

The proverbial wife and kids. This category is about gauging how your family relationships can be made stronger.


## Category 3: Original Family

How are you getting along with the people you grew up with: Mom, Dad, and your siblings? In my case, since I no longer have living parents, I like to phone up people who have played my parents in movies, such as Richard Kind (Clifford), just to let them know I still care.


## Category 4: Friends

Are your friendships in a healthy place? Are you keeping in touch with everyone adequately? Are there any seething undercurrents of resentment that need to be put on the table and worked out? As a wise woman named Bette Midler once put it, “You’ve got to have good friends and good lighting.”


## Category 5: Money

Beatrice Kaufman, the wife of the playwright George S. Kaufman and a fellow member of the Algonquin Round Table, once said, “I’ve been rich and I’ve been poor. Rich is better.” I’m with Beatrice. I believe it was also Beatrice who said, “Money can’t buy you happiness, but at Exotic Thai Massage, it can buy some relief.” Or was that Donald Trump?



## Category 6: Career

As it says on my answering service, “I’ll take it.”

In my business, there’s a traditional career path: TV, movies, Broadway, your own reality show, Chabad Telethon performer, the Palm Springs Follies, and writing your autobiography. So what grade do you give your working life?

At this very moment I’d give mine a solid grade, although, cumulatively, I still feel that I’m two films short of making the Oscars-night memorial reel.



## Category 7: Creativity 

Beyond the amount-of-work aspect, is your work creatively fulfilling? Innate creativity is a wonderful blessing. But when I look at George W. Bush’s paintings, I wonder if a pill could be invented that causes something called painter’s block.

## Category 8: Discipline

Not just the simple imperative of self-preservation as addressed in Category 1, but having the self-control to actually implement your goals. In my underemployed-actor days, I used this category as motivation: I’m not working, but I’ll use this time to get into the best shape of my life. Or to read more, or write more, or do more of what I feel I should do so that this fallow period jobwise won’t be wasted time. Discipline is essential to life, whether you are administering or inflicting the spanking.

## Category 9: Lifestyle

Put aside all the usual yardsticks of success and well-being: Oscars, Tonys, Emmys, deals, yachts, beach houses, penis length. Are you actually enjoying life? Are you having any fun? And, God forbid, are you doing something to make the world a better place?

# Implementation of the 9 Categories

Extract from Martin Short's book:

"The Nine Categories have been a part of my life for more than thirty-five years now. Every Monday I assign myself a grade in each category, augmenting the grades with comments. I used to do this by hand, in a spiral-bound notebook, but now I do it on the computer. Some categories have subcategories. In Category 1, for example, I keep track of my weight using color-coded classifications based on the old Tom Ridge Homeland Security alert system. So let’s say my ideal weight is 142 pounds. (I’m not a tall man.) That means that the 142–44 range would be blue (“Looking Fine”), 145–47 would be yellow (“Guarded”), 148–50 would be orange (“Elevated—subject must go on diet”), and 150 and up would be red (“Severe—subject no longer requires fat suit to play Jiminy Glick”).

Green (“Low”) would denote that I’m fasting for a role à la Jared Leto or Matthew McConaughey, or perhaps dying.

I also maintain week-at-a-glance files, the upcoming week detailed in red lettering, the week just past recorded in black: yet another way to review my activities in total and see how they will impact, or have impacted, my overall well-being. I’ll note, say, that I deserve an A in career for the week I’ve spent prepping for a Broadway show, but I’ll also see that I’ve failed to return Eugene Levy’s call, or that my children are no longer speaking to me, and I’ll think, hey, Marty, you’d better put that right.

My manager, Bernie Brillstein, who passed away in 2008, was convinced that the Nine Categories system was my ticket to untold riches as a self-help guru. “Kid, I’m tellin’ ya,” he’d say, “you’re sittin’ on a fuckin’ self-help bible!” (Bernie looked like a Jewish Santa Claus and talked like a Hoboken stevedore.)

“The color-coded weight, the Nine Categories . . . it’s a Goddamned life philosophy,” Bernie told me. “You do the book and we’ll book you on Oprah. It’s real simple.”

Bernie’s idea was tempting, but ultimately, I’m no evangelist. The Nine Categories are a tremendous aid to me, but they are not something I push on other people, not even my own kids. I preside over a cult of one."

One of the crucial benefits of the Nine Categories is that they’ve gotten me through the many uneven periods of my career and kept in focus the true priorities of life. Maybe, at times, the inconsistency and iffy quality of some of the work I took on held my “career” grade down, but this would only encourage me to push my “creativity” grade as high and fearlessly as I could. In the 1970s, for example, audiences weren’t yet conditioned, as they are now, to laugh at the very sight of me, so I could do straight drama, like a production of Clifford Odets’s Paradise Lost for Canadian television. On the flip side, I had nothing to lose by trying my hand at stand-up comedy, so I did. Once.

## Objective

List the objectives of the application and the if possible a high-level detail of the features proposed here. 

* **Category Questions:** Provide a form to allow the user to set and answer questions weekly. The questions are aligned to the category and help the user set a grade for how they are doing in this category.
* **Sub-Categories:** Some categories may have sub-categories that have questions and grades aligned with these are that summed to provide the final score for this category.
* **User Settable Grades:** The user may set a grade for each of their categories and sub categories.
* **Journal Entry:** The user should be able to have a journal entry that they can freeform write about their last week for each category and overall week.
* **Todos:** The User may have todo list items that they find during the journaling. There should be a textbox that allows todos to be captured. 
* **GPA:** The grades from each category are then able to be summed up as a GPA and provided to the user at the end.
* **Dashboard:** The user should be able to see their weekly grades and GPA over the weeks they have been journaling. 

  
## Feature

#### Category Questions:

UC1: As a user I want to be able to add and edit questions to the MS9C form so that I have personalised entries that I can grade against. 

AC1: Given that I am a user when I add a question then I should be able to see this in the interface. 

AC2: Given that I am a user when I want to edit a question then I should be able to change the question title and body text.

**Proposed Backlog**

The backlog is prioritized based on what needs to be built to reach minimum viability. Must-Haves are critical for launch, High-Wants provide good value but aren’t necessary, and Nice-To-Haves are conveniences.

1.  **(Must-Have)** After answering a grammar question about *|topic|*, student must answer a *|topic|* question: Would you like more sentences about *|topic|*?
2.  **(Must-Have)** This process repeats until student has answered 40 *|topic|* questions and met minimum interest number.
3.  **(Must-Have)** Not answering *|topic|* questions will send a prompt to the student to answer. “Answering this question is required.  It makes sure we give you topics that you enjoy.” (Answers case of not responding)
4.  **(High-Want)** *|topic|* algorithm learns students interests and can present *|topics|* students are more likely to enjoy based on previous selections.
5.  **(Nice-To-Have)** During this assessment phase, *|topic|* is selected randomly from a pool of interests that a majority of students in that demographic (age, grade, etc.) like.
6.  **(Nice-To-Have)** Traditional interest selection page will be accessible as an option in preferences
7.  **(Nice-To-Have)** Interests can be viewed by students in their preference page.
8.  **(Nice-To-Have)** Teachers have a view on their dashboard with most liked student topics.
9.  **(Nice-To-Have)** Feature flag to toggle new system for specific users.

We are assuming 40 *|topic|* questions is enough to reach the minimum interest number.  Ideally, we’d speak with data team to determine # of questions so that 99% of students reach the minimum interest number.  What happens in the corner case where a student doesn’t like any *|topic|* after 40+ questions? We can send a follow up email to speak with the student directly and perhaps discover missing interests or user stories.

## Prototype

The Like System should be prototyped on Proto.io to reduce development and market risks. We’ll run it by our engineers first for a feasibility test (Can this be built? How? Can it be built in timeframe?).  This will allow us to refine our spec. Next, we can run a usability test with UX and, if possible, students (Can they figure out how to use it? Are there any missing requirements?). The purpose is to discover and fix issues before entering an expensive development phase.  

## Test

Students and teachers don’t want to waste class time on a nonfunctional feature.  When the feature is built, we’ll test internally in the dev environment first and re-evaluate.  Then, we should ask for opt-ins to try the new system. This sets expectations with users, so if issues occur, they will be more accepting.  If we can reach 9601 students with opt-ins, our results will have 95% confidence with 1% margin of error.

We can start with 10% of opt-ins on launch day and gradually ramp up to 100% in 4 days. Gradual ramp up allows us to control issues (e.g. stop full deployment until discovered bugs are fixed).  More importantly, releasing only to opt-ins means we can test against a control group (traditional interest selection page users).

## Metrics

The Like System has, effectively, a Time to Assignment of zero, making comparison on this metric a bit of a strawman.  I’d say our northstar metrics should express implicitly or explicitly student satisfaction with personalization and teacher satisfaction with setup.  Comparing two groups with different user numbers means that we should focus on percentages and rates rather than raw numbers.

-   **Weekly Active Users/Total Users:** This retention type data allows us to understand implicitly whether the personalization process is satisfactory. Equal or higher percentage in the opt-in group compared with the control group indicates success.
-   **Feedback Ticket % (Personalization Process):** A statistically higher percentage of negative feedback for the personalization process  in the opt-in group suggests we’ve failed to deliver with our new system.
-   **Interest Completion Rate:** Are enough students reaching the Minimum Interest Number for personalization?  Are we comfortable w/ the trade off (speed vs. completion rate)?

## Next Steps

-   **If we see low student satisfaction (complaints and low retention)**, we’d do a biopsy to determine causes. For example, do students feel like they lack control over interests now? If so, will interest options in the preferences page change that?
-   **If the test succeeds, we can roll out to our entire base with new onboarding and support documents.  We can look at how it can utilized for other feedback functions.**

## Timeline

-   Day 1 – First Draft and Team Feedback
-   Day 2 – Second Draft
-   Day 3 – Prototype
-   Day 4 – Feasibility Test and Adjustments
-   Day 5 – Usability Test and Adjustments
-   Day 6 – Spec Review: Enough info for team to build? What’s missing?
-   Day 7 – Design
-   Day 8 – Development
-   Day 12 – Test w/ Team on Dev Environment and Re-evaluate
-   Day 13 – Send Opt-in Email
-   Day 16 – Launch to Opt-ins (QA and I on deck to respond to issues)
-   Day 23 – Sync (Weekly) for Issues and New Tasks
-   Day 37 – Final Sync (Review Stats, Continue or Next Test?)

## Summary

We’ll improve interest selection by removing the traditional interest page and allowing students to like topics at the end of each question or assignment.  Our users are sensitive to disruptions, so we will prototype and test first before rolling out to a opt-in group. We’ll make adjustments during the project. At the end, we’ll analyze the results and decide whether to continue to next steps or try other solutions.  The total time for the project is 6 weeks.

## Additional Thoughts

With more time, I would include wireframes with the spec because it makes understanding the feature improvements much easier.  Engineers, UX, QA, and Data are brought in early to optimize for success. They can unveil conditions or requirements that may have been overlooked. We’ve assumed that the Like System is relatively easy to implement, but there may be underlying systems that make it complicated.  Engineering would be able to quickly point that out in a feasibility test before development occurs. The backlog items can also be linked with objectives to better explain their impact on the value proposition.

There are a few caveats as well.  For example, the students could be satisfied with the Like System, but teachers may dislike the extra time students take to answer their assignments. Is this worthwhile tradeoff to make? We’d probably need to do expected value calculations to determine that.  A/B testing may be difficult if teachers onboarding students is not a frequent activity. We’d have to plan around specific onboarding windows (likely seasonal).

Finally, I made a tradeoff to focus on a system that is probably harder to build but leveraged for all types of feedback.  This kind of data has high upside in a SaaS business such as NoRedInk. Other features may have more proven results or easier implementation.  They would be great choices if we need to hit specific metrics in a certain timeframe.
